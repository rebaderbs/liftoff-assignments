### Overview
Tired of chaotic travel planning that involves too many resources and information overload? Us too! Travel Buddy is an all-in-one travel application that streamlines the process of planning a trip. Instead of having to go through multiple sites to plan a trip (i.e - location, food, activities, budget tracker), let Travel Buddy be your guide. 

Because of its integrated data sources, Travel Buddy will become your one-stop-shop for planning your adventures. From where to stay, what to eat, and what to do - you'll no longer suffer from analysis paralysis while reading twenty different travel blogs for recommendations. 

In addition, Travel Buddy will be useful to all types of travelers: from the world traveler with a passport book full of stamps, to the homebody wanting to plan a simple weekend away from home. Come see what our application can do for your travel needs.
